# wasim-portfolio-

As a new student at a University of Denver coding bootcamp, i am working to build my portfolio to show my work to the employers in the future. As a full stack web developer i want to build this project to proof my abiliy of building different projects using different technologies. This project shows the front end design of my web page using HTML and CSS as i extensively learned in the first week. In this web page i used different CSS elements like disply: flex; and flex-wrap: wrap; to make it a responsive web page that can still be readable on many screen sizes like laptops, tablets, and smart phones.

In the following section bellow i attach some screenshots with the link of this project and the previous refactoring project.
